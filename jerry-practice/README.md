# Jerry-practice

This is a Jerry code testing project through which testing expects candidates to prove that they can develop clear, extensible, testable, and deliverable code.

The test questions are as follows

Problem Set below:
> Task: Implement a class named 'RangeList'
> A pair of integers define a range, for example: [1, 5). This range includes integers: 1, 2, 3, and 4.
> A range list is an aggregate of these ranges: [1, 5), [10, 11), [100,201)
